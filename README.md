# Random Password Generator

## How it Works
This script generates random passwords using Python's native 'secrets' module. As the official [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/secrets.html#:~:text=is%20used%20for%20generating%20cryptographically%20strong%20random%20numbers) says, it is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets. 

You can choose the length of your password and what you want to include in your password (Upper and lower case letters, or both, numbers, symbols, or all of them).

The "password" function in password_generator.py accepts string arguments, which can be hardcoded (like in program.py at the moment) or can be the users input (these are commented out in program.py at the moment).

## Example Passwords Generated

I generated a million password just for fun, here are some of them. This took about a minute and some change and wasn't all that CPU intensive, the highest my CPU spiked to was 46%.
